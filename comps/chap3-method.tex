In this work, we will investigate alcohol-water mixtures of 8 different 
alcohols with the solution concentrations varying from 2\% to 50\% for each.
The investigated alcohols include:\\
- ethylene glycol\\
- ethanol\\
- methanol\\
- glycerol\\ 
- 1-propanol\\
- 2-propanol\\ 
- 1,3-propanediol\\
- propylene glycol\\
as they are alcohol types that were used as industrial antifreeze.
The methodology is operated according to the following diagram

\section{Machine Learning Implementation}
Two sets of data will be prepared: a training data set and a testing data set. 
The training data set is used to construct the model while the testing data 
set is left unused throughout the training process and only used in 
approximating the true error so that the model is not overfit. We will make 
a model of thermal conductivity and a model of viscosity.

The parameter set for each model are decided by using k-fold methods. 
Within the possible range of parameters, every combination of parameters 
is cross-validated using the k-fold methodology and then the training 
performance scores are compared. The parameter set of the model that has 
the best training performance score will be chosen.
The selected parameter sets will be used to create the models with the 
training data set. The constructed models will then be tested on the 
testing data set to obtain the performance score. 

To thoroughly analyze the machine learning implementation, the training 
data set and testing data set will be decided by 2 ways: 
random and out of sample.
The random method is to randomly divided the entire data set into the 
training data set and the testing data set and create the models. 
The resulting models will be used to progress to the final step.
The out of sample method is to completely exclude an alcohol type out of 
the training sample. Four alcohol types, namely propylene glycol, methanol. 
2-propanol and glycerol, will be in turn excluded to assess the 
characteristics of machine learning approach in this problem.

The performance score of the testing and training processes will be 
calculated using the $R^2$ score method as follows:
\begin{equation}
    R^{2}=1-\frac{S S R}{T S S}
\end{equation}
Where
\begin{equation}
    S S R=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}-f\left(x_{i}\right)\right)^{2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    T S S=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}-\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} y_{j}\right)^{2}
\end{equation}
Furthermore, SSR stands for squared sum of residual, TSS stands for total squared sum, 
y is the real value, $f(x_i)$ is the predicted value, n is the number of data in 
the data sample and i and j are data indices.
\section{Optimization}
In the optimization step, I will find the optimal values of desired properties 
while returning the corresponding inputs, which is the structural features in 
this work. The finding is done by setting up an optimization problem with an 
objective function and different constraints. The objective function guides 
the computer to find the optimal results while the constraints help us to 
remove the unrealistic outcomes.\\
This work considers optimization of thermal conductivity and viscosity. 
Thus, the problem will be described as follows:\\
Maximize:
\begin{equation}
    \alpha \frac{T C-\overline{T C}}{\sigma_{T C}}-\beta \frac{V i s c-\overline{V i s c}}{\sigma_{V i s c}}
    \label{eq:obj} 
\end{equation}
Subject to:\\
- The number of alcohol molecules $>$ 0\\
- The number of carbons and oxygens $>$ 0\\
- The position of OH groups $>$ 0\\
- The length of the main carbon chain $<$ the number of carbons\\
- The number of total molecules $<$ 2100 (estimated number that fits in the investigated volume)\\
- Every input is integer\\
Where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the weighting factors that define the importance of the 
thermal conductivity and viscosity. In this research, we value the thermal 
conductivity and the viscosity equally, which means $\alpha=\beta=1$. $\sigma_{T C}$ is the standard 
deviation of the sample thermal conductivity values, $\sigma_{Visc}$ is the standard 
deviation of the sample viscosity values, $\overline{T C}$ is the mean of the sample 
thermal conductivity values and $\overline{V i s c}$ is the mean of the sample viscosity 
values. The values of thermal conductivity and viscosity will be first 
standardized before processed in the objective function \ref{eq:obj}.
