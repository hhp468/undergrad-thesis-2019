\section{Simulation Results}
The calculated properties from Molecular Dynamics simulations are presented 
in the following forms

\end{figure}

As expected in the thermal conductivity graph, all the thermal conductivity 
lines decreased due to the fact that all types of alcohol are less efficient 
than water in terms of heat transfer. Even though having a decreasing trend, 
the gradient of the thermal conductivity line of glycerol was quite different 
compared to others. Due to the absence of enthalpy quantity, all values 
converge to approximately 0.85 [W/m.K], which is expected.

In the viscosity graph, while all values converged to the value of pure water, 
which is expected, the viscosity line of methanol also decreased as methanol 
is less viscous than water.

\section{Optimization Results}
Using the formulation \ref{eq:obj} and the related constraints, the results for 
optimization showed that the alcohol types with the following estimated 
structural features will have the optimal performance on both thermal 
conductivity and viscosity:

    \end{tabular}
    \label{table:prop}
\end{table}

As we can see, the best mixture is almost water, as water so far has the best 
thermal conductivity and viscosity. Furthermore, one of the molecular 
structures that can be constructed from these predicted features is glycerol, 
which is the type of alcohol that has the highest thermal conductivity and 
quite good viscosity across mass concentrations of alcohol-water mixtures 
according to the simulated data. This is showing that the methodology is 
approaching on the right direction. In the future work, with the additional 
constraint of freezing point, the method will be able to produce the desired 
outcome. Even though we obtained the features, the lack of diversity in terms 
of molecular structure from the sample data prevents us from constructing a 
complete structure. Thus, in the future where this method is applied, the 
sample data need to be sufficiently diverse enough as discussed in the 
previous sub-section. At the same time, an interpreting method should also be 
developed to translate from the broken down molecular structural features to 
a complete structure.
