I am thankful for being a member of this project, for
the people that I have been with and cooperate and 
for the experience i have gained professionally and individually that support my self development
\\
I owe my appreciation to Prof. James J Cannon for being an understanding advisor, 
a friend and an important teacher. I am thankful to him for providing me a 
freedom of research environment, a chance to explore myself professionally and 
personally, for providing me personal advices when I was in crises and for 
letting me try my most non-sense ideas.\\
I send my gratitude to Prof. Hiroshi Takamatsu for accepting me into this 
laboratory, for being personally and professionally supportive by 
constructive critisms and advices that I would never think of without him,
for sharing me his favourite drink and for showing me the world of research.\\
I am grateful to Prof. Kurata and all of former and current Heat and Mass Transfer
laboratory members that I have met, for being so kind, for helping me blend in 
the culture difference, for all of the professional advices and for giving me 
unforgettable memories.\\
I greatly appreciate my best friend Tuan Do for all of his support in my 
personal and professional life. Without his lessons, I could not have been 
able to finish this work. Without his mid-night talks, I could have quit 
mid-way because of depression and lost of direction.\\
I am also lucky to have wonderful friends in my IUPE (G30) program for always 
supporting me through my hard times and for being a part of my memorable 
university life.\\
Finally, I owe my greatest appreciation to my family, my father, my mother,
my sister and my cousin for being the 
strongest mental support and for trusting me, giving me a chance to be who 
i am today.
