All these liquids have been divided into six chemistries and a methodology has been presented to compare their overall efficiency, which was determined from heat transfer rate as well as pumping power requirements in microchannels. It was found that potassium formate (PF) solution exhibits the highest overall efficiency among the coolant chemistries evaluated. Other factors such as flammability, toxicity, corrosivity and electrical conductivity have been discussed in reference to these coolants. Based on electrical conductivity, liquid coolants have been divided into three categories: (1) liquid in which direct immersion cooling is possible; (2) liquid in which direct immersion is not possible but a leak or a spill will not damage the electronics; and (3) liquid in which neither direct immersion nor leakage is tolerable.},

	abstract = {In the machine learning field, the performance of a classifier is usually measured in terms of prediction error. In most real-world problems, the error cannot be exactly calculated and it must be estimated. Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate estimator of the error. This paper analyzes the statistical properties, bias and variance, of the k-fold cross-validation classification error estimator (k-cv). Our main contribution is a novel theoretical decomposition of the variance of the k-cv considering its sources of variance: sensitivity to changes in the training set and sensitivity to changes in the folds. The paper also compares the bias and variance of the estimator for different values of k. The experimental study has been performed in artificial domains because they allow the exact computation of the implied quantities and we can rigorously specify the conditions of experimentation. The experimentation has been performed for two classifiers (naive Bayes and nearest neighbor), different numbers of folds, sample sizes, and training sets coming from assorted probability distributions. We conclude by including some practical recommendation on the use of k-fold cross validation.},

In addition, the major contributions of heat transfer modes for thermal conductivity due to convection, interaction, and torque are obtained quantitatively. This study reveals that the intramolecular interaction force fields result in different conformations of the EG in the liquid and thus the molecular shapes. The trans/gauche ratio for EG's O–Me–Me–O torsional angle and the number of intermolecular/intramolecular H-bonds are found to be important parameters affecting the thermal conductivity.},

	abstract = {The parametrization and testing of the OPLS all-atom force field for organic molecules and peptides are described. Parameters for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted mostly from the AMBER all-atom force field. The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/6-31G*//RHF/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2\% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

	abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

	abstract = {In this study, two alcohol molecules, propanol and ethylene glycol, of similar atomic
composition but varying thermal conductivity and viscosity are studied from an
atomic perspective to elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for such
disparity. The thermal conductivity and viscosity contributions were subjected to two
levels of breakdown- first by different modes of interaction (including bonded
interactions due to change in angles, bond length, etc. and pairwise non-bonded
interactions such as coulomb and van der Walls) and a further finer breakdown by
pairwise atomic interactions (coulomb and van der Walls). Molecular dynamics
simulations, through the use of Green-Kubo formalisms, were employed to calculate
the data necessary for such an investigation.
The study showed that, among the mode interactions, pairwise interaction was the
biggest factor responsible for the difference in the properties, necessitating the need to
xexamine it further. Subsequent pairwise atomic breakdown clearly quantifies the
contribution due to individual atomic interactions, where interactions with hydroxyl
groups in the alcohols is seen to play a significant role in determining thermal
conductivity and viscosity. Interaction mechanisms of atoms are further analyzed to
explain the difference in thermo-physical properties between the molecules under
study.},
